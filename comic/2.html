				"Almi wore tattered clothes. Sometimes he found old clothes lying around, and sometimes, he found fresh ones, laying in the grass next to the great walls that enclosed the site.",
				"He also wore his sandals which became worn-out over the years, and a symbolic, well-kept, green headband, one given to each Sylverde child once they become worthy of responsibility - usually at the age of 12.",

				"As per routine, he walked out into the lush, open grounds and made his way towards a staggering <b>OMNIA TEMPLE<b>.",
				"Yawning as he walked down the rubbled, dirt-covered steps, a green orb of light flew out from within his tent towards him - an essence accompanying each member of the temple, called an <b>ELVEN SPIRIT<b>.",
				"Together, they began to wander, illuminated by a violet nebula sprawling across the night sky.",
				"Over the next few minutes, the spirit slowly manifested a ghostly, humanoid form, and about half-way to the temple, once the path was enclosed by trees, several more figures appeared in the shadows; hooded silhouettes draped in green.",
				"The manifesting visions in the corner of his sight made sure to only be seen for a moment, for they disappeared once he glanced at them.",
				"He began to walk quicker.",
