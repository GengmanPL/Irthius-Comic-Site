				"Port Town, west coast of <b>Varlia</b>",
				"As the light fog settled amongst the cobblestones, and the soft drops of rain fell from the patchy roof tiles, a scarfed figure silently wandered the streets.",
				"His face, gently illuminated by the <b>GRAND NEBULA</b>, held a bittersweet expression; his gaze sorrow and contempt.",
				"His eyes, the left coloured teal, and the right violet, panned to a narrow alleyway tucked in amidst the stone buildings, lit by a handful of lanterns.",
				"This path, which he embarked on every night, loomed in front of him, and yet always felt welcoming despite its foreboding allure.",
				"Seeking solace in the sanctuary of his own discovery, <b>Navick FALENIS</b> turned to a-",
				"Navick",
				"Did you just quote the tale of the Hollow Ember?",
				"...",
				"Seeking <s>solace</s> <span class='grey-text'><u>a specific book on <b>BOTANICAL MYSTICISM</b> in an obscure charity shop that he randomly found which is on the brink of closing because no one goes there let alone STAYS in this awful town because its AWFUL and this place is practically a GHOST TOWN for f-</u></span>",
				"Navick turned to a narrow set of steps near the end of the alleyway which led down to a wooden basement door.",
				"An amber glow radiated from a lantern hanging from a sign, which was in fact nothing but an inscribed wooden plank proudly displaying the shop's name.",
				"The nebula's glow coated the door in a faint indigo hue, shining off its metal handle, as if tempting for it to be opened.",
				"Navick made sure to keep his two <b>BOTANICAL SPIRITS</b> tucked away into his scarf.",
				"Navick",
				"Don't want anyone here seeing them. They already think I'm weird.",
				"*ding!*",
				"And so the door was opened, greeting him with its distinct, friendly creak and the little ring of a bell. The smell of ancient tomes swirled his senses.",
				"Tan",
				"Welcome to Tan's! How can I hel-",
				"A man, sitting at a weathered, rustic desk, turned to face him.",
				"Ah, Navick! Nice to see you! Thought you wouldn't come today. What brings you so late? Ah forget it, fiction section's that way and to your right, near the other stairs.",
				"<i>Kids and their made-up stories... Heh, who knows what they're even reading. What happened to good ol' history?</i>",
				"After an exchange of nods, the man happily sighed, and returned to his worn, leather-bound book, and his late-night brew.",
				"Going down a step, to where the plateau of bookshelves lay dormant, Navick walked up and down the looming and narrow aisles, noticing nothing of importance to him.",
				"A wooden ladder with papers and books fallen over underneath it,",
				"...small foggy windows right under the ceiling looking out onto the street above,",
				"...yet not what he was searching for.",
				"Navick",
				"I feel like I should know what to do.",
				"...yet the only thing I know, is that I know nothing.",
				"My name is Navick Falenis, and this is what I've found to be the universal law.",
				"We humans live out our lives based on patterns and assumptions.",
				"And despite our collective hunger for answers,",
				"we don't always get them.",
				"and they usually give even more questions.",
				"My soul is split into two halves. Neither one is complete.",
				"Two worldviews. Two perspectives. Slightly different from one another, but neither fully coherent.",
				"I don't know why I was born like this.",
				"No one so far could explain it.",
				'"Demon-possessed"',
				'"A freak of nature"',
				"What does man fear more, than that which he does not understand?",
				"This is why I've made it my mission to abandon the safe, and venture into the unknown.",
				"But recently, two Botanical Spirits have bound themselves to me.",
				"An <b>ELVEN SPIRIT</b>, and an <b>ELDRITCH SPIRIT</b>",
				"From my research, spirits are sustained by their host's soul. It seems as though they have bound themselves to my \"half souls\".",
				"Not long after that, the Elven spirit fell ill, and so did I.",
				"This time, I <u>need</u> answers. Fast."
