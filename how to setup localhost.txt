open command prompt

paste this:
cd C:\Users\skuba\Desktop\Irthius Site Comic

paste this:
python -m http.server --bind 127.0.0.1

this will create a localhost server for the website.
that last bit makes sure only you can access it.

then go to http://localhost:8000 on your browser
and navigate to the correct folder

and kaboom! local host :)
